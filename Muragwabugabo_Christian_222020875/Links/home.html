                On 15-17 March 2024, more than two years into the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression 
on Ukraine, and one month after the sudden death in custody of the opposition leader Alexei 
Navalny, Russia will hold its presidential election. Over 110 million Russian citizens, including more 
than 6 million living in Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied by Russia, are invited to take 
part in what is largely seen as a carefully staged legitimisation ritual for Vladimir Putin's 
reappointment to a fifth term in office, until 2030. 
Putin has been in power, as either president or prime minister, since the last day of 1999; and 
Russia has been at war for 19 of his 24 years at the helm. The constitutional changes of 2020 
allowed Putin to stand for a fifth term, and possibly for a sixth term in 2030. He is running for reelection without any meaningful opposition, after barring the two anti-war candidates who stood 
for election despite the restrictions, and against a backdrop of a virtually total closure of the civic 
space, draconian repression of public dissent and suppressed freedom of expression.
